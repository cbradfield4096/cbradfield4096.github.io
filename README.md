# Conventions #
Since this is an evolving project intended to accelerate learning (which for now requires copious comments) and does not presently have multiple branches I have chosen to create and implement a few conventions and standards to make comment-heavy code more readable.
* line comments are often used to identify the functionality or rationale for a few lines of code
* end-of-line comments are used to 
    * make eternal source and documentation references that give credit and provide additional instructions
    * explain the preceeding code
* comments generally begin with a `#` sign followed by a space*
* use of certain substrings is reseved in order to enable quick generation of various lists
    * `#tod0` is reserved for to-do list items so that future work can be planned in line comments even in the absence of an external project management/planning tools
    * `#?` is used to begin commented code or plain text comments for code whose usage is questionable and subject to future review and verification
* commented code generally appears at the beginning of lines
